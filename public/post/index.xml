      <description>“It’s safer, less painful and less soul destroying to remain a dot watcher.”
With those words for inspiration, this post takes dot watching several levels too far.

      <description>Data from my rides have been scattered in several places. Through the years I moved from Excel to Access to Ascent to Strava to store ride data. Recently the following have provided the potential to make combining these data easy:
 workflow, particularly with  tidyverse rmarkdown  apps to rip data out of MS Access databases from a mac mdb accdb Viewer the export .csv button on most pages on Veloviewer  This is the piecing together and exploration of those data.</description>
