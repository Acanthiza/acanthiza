      <description>Given an 11-46 cluster, what is a good front chain ring for a 1-by setup on a 700c rim with a 38 mm tyre?
Figure 1 shows front chain ring, rear cog, speed and cadence change in relation to an upper and lower speed target. Targets were chosen as 6 km/hr as close to walking speed and 45 km/hr as it’s rare I travel faster than that.
Cadence was chosen in steps of 10 between 50 rpm and 110 rpm.</description>

      <description>Baffled by bike geometry? So am I, so don’t look for answers here. But here’s how I’ve helped myself scratch the surface of understanding… And began to understand just how much of an outlier my current bike is as a ‘gravel’ bike.
The main guides for the important numbers to chase were:
 this CylingTips article this great resource on gravel bikes covering geometry in part two geometrygeeks.com provides good explanations of each term.</description>

      <description>“It’s safer, less painful and less soul destroying to remain a dot watcher.”
With those words for inspiration, this post takes dot watching several levels too far.
For an introduction to Race to the Rock perhaps read about the first 2016 ride. Race to the rock happened again in 2017 and 2018. There’s an active online community serving up a constant stream of visual inspiration.</description>

      <description>Data from my rides have been scattered in several places. Through the years I moved from Excel to Access to Ascent to Strava to store ride data. Recently the following have provided the potential to make combining these data easy:
 workflow, particularly with  tidyverse rmarkdown  apps to rip data out of MS Access databases from a mac mdb accdb Viewer the export .csv button on most pages on Veloviewer  This is the piecing together and exploration of those data.</description>
