      <description>Given an 11-46 cluster, what is a good front chain ring for a 1-by setup on a 700c rim with a 38 mm tyre?
Figure 1 shows front chain ring, rear cog, speed and cadence change in relation to an upper and lower speed target. Targets were chosen as 6 km/hr as close to walking speed and 45 km/hr as itâ€™s rare I travel faster than that.
Cadence was chosen in steps of 10 between 50 rpm and 110 rpm.</description>
