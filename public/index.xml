      <description>Having Strava do all the work makes recording segments (efforts/laps) all too easy. It used to take pressing the lap button at the start and end of a climb and then scrolling through that data post-ride to enter the data into MS Access - not a process I miss.
Given the plethora of segments on Strava these days, filtering segments of interest is essential. As a starting point, I retrieved starred segments ridden more than 40 times.</description>

      <description>data rides nature This is my first bumbling attempt at a website. The only goal at the moment is to learn a workflow from data to web. If it&amp;rsquo;s useful or interesting too, well great. All posts should be reproducible from code and data on github.
For the workflow i&amp;rsquo;m particularly grateful to:
 R Core Team R-studio The tidyverse Yihui Xie  R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics - its where everything happens.</description>

      <description>“It’s safer, less painful and less soul destroying to remain a dot watcher.”
With those words for inspiration, this post takes dot watching several levels too far.
For an introduction to Race to the Rock perhaps read about the first 2016 ride. Race to the rock happened again in 2017 and 2018. There’s an active online community serving up a constant stream of visual inspiration.</description>

      <description>Data from my rides have been scattered in several places. Through the years I moved from MS Excel to MS Access to Ascent to Strava to store ride data. Recently the following have provided the potential to make combining these data easy:
 workflow, particularly with  tidyverse rmarkdown  apps to rip data out of MS Access databases from a mac mdb accdb Viewer the export .csv button on most pages on Veloviewer  This is the piecing together and exploration of those data.</description>
