      <description>Having Strava do all the work makes recording segments (efforts/laps) all too easy. It used to take pressing the lap button at the start and end of a climb and then scrolling through that data post-ride to enter the data into MS Access - not a process I miss.
Given the plethora of segments on Strava these days, filtering segments of interest is essential. As a starting point, I retrieved starred segments ridden more than 40 times.</description>

      <description>“It’s safer, less painful and less soul destroying to remain a dot watcher.”
With those words for inspiration, this post takes dot watching several levels too far.
For an introduction to Race to the Rock perhaps read about the first 2016 ride. Race to the rock happened again in 2017 and 2018. There’s an active online community serving up a constant stream of visual inspiration.</description>
