This is my first bumbling attempt at a website. The only goal at the moment is to learn a workflow from data to web. If it's useful or interesting too, well great. All posts should be reproducible from code and data on [github](https://github.com/Acanthiza?tab=repositories).

For the workflow i'm particularly grateful to:

* [R Core Team](https://www.r-project.org/contributors.html)
* [R-studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* The [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/)
* [Yihui Xie](https://yihui.name/en/)

R is a language and environment for statistical computing and graphics - its where everything happens. R-studio makes using R easy. The tidyverse is an ecosystem growing within the R environment that makes the data science learning curve massively shallower - enabling users to 'fall into the pit of success' (I think that was a Hadley Wickham quote?). Yihui Xie is responsible for a bunch of packages that enable workflow from data source to product (webpage, .pdf, whatever).

Who knows what will end up here. The guidance so far suggests three of my favourite things:

* data
* riding
* nature
