<p>Baffled by bike geometry? So am I, so don’t look for answers here. But here’s how I’ve helped myself scratch the surface of understanding… And began to understand just how much of an outlier my current bike is as a ‘gravel’ bike.</p>
<hr />
<p>The main guides for the important numbers to chase were:</p>
<ul>
<li>this <a href="https://cyclingtips.com/2011/02/the-geometry-of-bike-handling/">CylingTips article</a></li>
<li>this great resource on <a href="http://teknecycling.com/how-to-choose-a-gravel-bike-part-2-geometry/">gravel bikes</a> covering geometry in part two</li>
<li><a href="https://geometrygeeks.bike/understanding-bike-geometry">geometrygeeks.com</a> provides good explanations of each term.</li>
</ul>
<p>Gaps in geometry were filled in (as best as possible) using this <a href="https://www.bikegeocalc.com/#7Unnameda0b4c743.9802d270e600.64877f769.85608g971.72104h412.76493i340j340k1335l813.03517m1133.98576n679.88726o1177.24813p889.84772q1213.32131r1345.15065s893.89606t31.8u40v6w2x10y280z40A0B150C25D370E45F172.5G30H30Z">bike geometry calculator</a>. Frame size was taken from the ‘effective top tube’ length most manufacturers provide. This analysis focuses on the frame size closest to 55cm.</p>
<p>Analysing geometries accumulated from the web gives Figure <a href="#fig:pca">1</a> (principal components analysis [pca] on scaled and centred data). There are clusters of roadies, mtbs and tourers (520 and lets lump cutthroat in with ‘tourers’) respectively. Then there’s a spread of gravel/cx/endurance bikes between those clusters. The roadie cluster appears correlated with high head angle numbers and low chain stay numbers. The smear of endurance/gravel bikes have large bottom bracket drop and head tube angles. High reach and stack seem correlated with XC. The CX bikes are harder to (visually) correlate with any attribute.</p>

<p>Focussing on just the gravel(ish) bikes gives Figure <a href="#fig:figpcaGravel">2</a>. The Hook EXT-C.18 is closest to the middle of everything. The 2012 SuperX is a bit of an outlier compared to the other bikes here.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:uniGeo">3</a> gives a better sense of where a specific bike fits within each geometry attribute. A driver for creating this data set and analysis was to examine the attributes of a 2012 SuperX compared to gravel bikes. It apparently has lowish bbdrop (high bottom bracket), low fork rake and high head angle. The already high bottom bracket is made even higher by running the largest tyres that fit in the frame instead of the 32/33 mm tyres the frame was designed around. I’ve found the 2012 SuperX skittish at speed on loose surfaces. It does however handle sharp corners with ease. Time to replace it with something more suitable to its main use - long rides on quiet back roads, fire tracks and trails.</p>
