Data from my rides have been scattered in several places. Through the years I moved from Excel to Access to [Ascent](http://www.montebellosoftware.com/) to [Strava](http://www.strava.com) to store ride data. Recently the following have provided the potential to make combining these data easy:

* workflow, particularly with
    + [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/)
    + [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)
* apps to rip data out of MS Access databases from a mac [mdb accdb Viewer](https://eggerapps.at/mdbviewer/)
* the export .csv button on most pages on [Veloviewer](http://www.veloviewer.com)

This is the piecing together and exploration of those data.

Combining the datasets gives `r nrow(dat)` individual rides.

# Data checks

Probably best to check these data before using them for anything...

A series of visual plots as quick data checks.

---

```{r dataCheckRides, fig.cap = "Rides per day"}

  dat %>% dplyr::group_by(Date,Source) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(rides = n()) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date,rides, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3)
  
```

Nothing concerning here. Apparently rides were more likely to be combined within a day in Access and more likely to recorded individualy on Strava.
  
---

```{r dataCheckDist, fig.cap = "Daily distance (km)"}

  dat %>% dplyr::group_by(Date,Source) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(dailyDist = sum(Dist)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, dailyDist, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,dailyDist), inherit.aes = F)
  
```

All looks ok. A few patterns:

* A bunch of low km while living somewhere flat 2005-2007
* Increased frequency of very short rides after 2015
* Very few very short rides recorded in late 90s /early 00s

---

```{r dataCheckTime, fig.cap = "Daily time"}

  dat %>%
    dplyr::group_by(Date, Source) %>%
    dplyr::summarise(dailyTime = sum(Time)) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(dailyTime = as_datetime(dailyTime, origin = lubridate::origin)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, dailyTime, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,dailyTime), inherit.aes = F)

```

Again, looks fine. Patterns are almost identical to daily km.

---
  
```{r dataCheckAscent, fig.cap = "Daily ascent (m)"}

  dat %>% dplyr::filter(Ascent != 0) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, Ascent, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,Ascent), inherit.aes = F)
  
```

Ascent data only starts in ~2006 - a shame looking back as the bike computer from 2001 onwards recorded ascent. There's an increase in ascent after moving back to the hills in march 2007 and a drop after moving to the 'flats' in late 2014.

---

```{r dataCheckMaxHR} 
  
  dat %>% dplyr::filter(MaxHR != 0) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, MaxHR, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,MaxHR), inherit.aes = F)
  
```

Garmin/Strava websites must do a good job of filtering max heart rates that are dubious, cause i've never seen the ridiculous maximum heart rates shown here. This graph brings back memories of manually adjusting polar HR data to remove spurious data peaks (from memory that applied to speed as well as hr).

---

```{r dataCheckAvHR}
  
  dat %>% dplyr::filter(AvHR > 50) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, AvHR, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,AvHR), inherit.aes = F)
  
```

hmmm. seems i'm slowing down.

---

```{r dataCheckAvPwr}

  dat %>% dplyr::filter(Year > 2012, AvPwr > 50) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, AvPwr, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,AvPwr), inherit.aes = F)
  
```

I only got a power meter in 2012. I commuted on the cx (the bike with the power meter) from then until leaving the hills in late 2014. Seems there's opportunity to ride a bit harder these days. Patchy data is a reflection of the flaky nature of the [stages](https://stagescycling.com/) power meter - doubt i'd get another one.

---

```{r dataCheckTemp}
  
  dat %>% dplyr::filter(Temp != 0, Year > 2013) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, Temp, colour = Source)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      stat_smooth(aes(Date,Temp), inherit.aes = F)
  
```

This was surprising to me for some reason. Clearly it's warmer in summer and cooler in winter.

---

```{r dataCheckAvS}

  dat %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, AvS, colour = Commute)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      geom_smooth()
  
```

Wow, wtf is going on with Strava(Veloviewer) average speeds? That might take some looking into. Try recalculating from raw distance and time data.

---

```{r dataCheck2AvS}

  dat %>% dplyr::mutate(AvS2 = Dist/(Time/(60*60))) %>%
    ggplot(aes(Date, AvS2, colour = Commute)) +
      geom_point(shape = 16, size = 2, alpha = 0.3) +
      geom_smooth()
  
```

Much better. Some interesting patterns there with commutes/non-commute average speeds.

---

Some other interesting overall trends visible in these data:

* data gaps
    + early 2000s - can't really remember what happened there
    + 2009 distances (see note below)
    + 2015 (ankle injury - perhaps most obvious in the AvHR plot)
* increasing recording of short rides
* little obvious difference between devices (good), which for the record were (in order):
    + [Cateye Mity 2](https://www.cateye.com/files/manual_dl/1/457/MT200_v7_E.pdf)
    + [Cateye MSC-3Dx](https://www.cateye.com/files/manual_dl/7/487/3DxU_E_v1.pdf) (after early 2000s data gap)
    + [Polar s725x](https://www.polar.com/support_files/en/C225742500419A8AC2257097003888BC/Polar_S625X_S725X_user_manual_English.pdf) (ascent data starts about mid-2006)
    + [Garmin Edge 705](http://static.garmin.com/pumac/2297_OwnersManual.pdf) (after 2009 data gap)
    + [Garmin Edge 810](http://static.garmin.com/pumac/Edge810_OM_EN.pdf) (from where temperature data starts mid-2015)
    + [Wahoo elemnt bolt](https://au.wahoofitness.com/devices/bike-computers/gps-elemnt-bolt) (from September 2018 as the edge 810 stopped charging)
* the garmins seem to record dodgy maximum heart rates frequently (although perhaps i filtered this manually with the polar)
    + the premium heart rate strap may have fixed this in latter data (need to check purchase date...) 

For the missing 2009 speed/distance data - from memory my polar sensor was failing. I think I used to enter the distance manually after the ride. That's all stored in a '.tlp' file used by the 'Ascent' app. I've lost the registration key for the app so it's unobtainable at the moment. I managed to get the time and heart rate data by uploading the .hrm files to strava.

# Wrap-up

All the data finally in one spot. For the first time since abandoning MS Access in 2009 when we got a mac. Plenty here to keep a ride-data-nerd happy for a long time.
